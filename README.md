# Serverless ToDo List
Work in Progress

A personal application to allow me to create a checklist of items to complete. Utilising AWS DynamoDB to store the key and value contents of the list. This RESTful API will bring a great convenience as each day the checklist will reset each item back to incomplete, encouraging me to complete my tasks. I will be able to update and delete To Do tasks at ease to customise my daily needs using CRUD operations.

**Future Implementations**
- Reset task completion to false after the day is complete
- Create a front-end display to smoothly interact with the API


This project is to better my understanding of how to connect to Amazon Web Services via DynamoDB.
